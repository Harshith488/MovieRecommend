Movie Recommendation System in R is my first ever hands on project in Data Analytics. 
A recommendation system provides suggestions to the users through a filtering process that is based on user preferences and browsing history.
Item Based Colloborative Filtering System is constructed which finds similarity in the items based on the peopleâ€™s ratings of them.
